* Sentence Boundary Detection: 
  * Extracted features from a training dataset 
  * Trained the classifier 
  * Tested and calculated the accuracy 

* Collocations: 
  * Collected raw counts of unigrams and bigrams from a corpus
  * Implemented the chi-square and PMI measures
  
* Viterbi Part-of-speech Tagger
  * Collected and Stored raw counts of all the words and the tags of the training dataset.
  * Implemented the Viterbi Algorithm(assigned part-of-speech tags to all the words in the test dataset) and applied it on the test dataset.
